## Sample Website with API-based CMS

Node.js website is a website template with content managed from prismic.io (API-based CMS).

#### Getting started

Read [this guide](https://prismic.io/docs/examples/website#?lang=node) for instructions to create your repository and use the sample blog.

#### Deploy your Node.js website

An easy way to deploy your Node.js website is to use [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). Just follow these few simple steps once you have successfully [signed up](https://id.heroku.com/signup/www-header) and [installed the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):

Create a new Heroku application

```
$ heroku create
```

Initialize a new Git repository:

```
$ git init
$ heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
```

Commit your code to the Git repository and deploy it to Heroku:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
$ git push heroku master
```

Ensure you have at least one node running:

```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```

You can now browse your application online:

```
$ heroku open
```
